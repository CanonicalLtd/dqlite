/**
 * Encode and decode tuples of database values.
 *
 * A tuple is composed by a header and a body.
 *
 * The format of the header changes depending on whether the tuple is a sequence
 * of parameters to bind to a statement, or a sequence of values of a single row
 * yielded by a query.
 *
 * For a tutple of parameters the format of the header is:
 *
 *  8 bits: Number of values in the tuple.
 *  8 bits: Type code of the 1st value of the tuple.
 *  8 bits: Type code of the 2nd value of the tuple, or 0.
 *  8 bits: Type code of the 3rd value of the tuple, or 0.
 *  ...
 *
 * This repeats until reaching a full 64-bit word. If there are more than 7
 * parameters to bind, the header will grow additional 64-bit words as needed,
 * following the same pattern: a sequence of 8-bit slots with type codes of the
 * parameters followed by a sequence of zero bits, until word boundary is
 * reached.
 *
 * For a tuple of row values the format of the header is:
 *
 *  4 bits: Type code of the 1st value of the tuple.
 *  4 bits: Type code of the 2nd value of the tuple, or 0.
 *  4 bits: Type code of the 3rd value of the tuple, or 0.
 *  ...
 *
 * This repeats until reaching a full 64-bit word. If there are more than 16
 * values, the header will grow additional 64-bit words as needed, following the
 * same pattern: a sequence of 4-bit slots with type codes of the values
 * followed by a sequence of zero bits, until word boundary is reached.
 *
 * After the header the body follows immediately, which contains all parameters
 * or values in sequence, encoded using type-specific rules.
